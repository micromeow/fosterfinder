# Architectural Decision Records

## Getting Started

TLDR; An Architectural Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs are a lightweight and effective way to document architectural decisions and communicate them to stakeholders. They provide a record of the motivations behind a decision as well as its impact on the project. ADRs are a valuable artifact for knowledge management and transfer, project governance, and decision accountability.

For a more detailed ADR on why we chose to use ADRs, read "[adr.md](./adr.md)".

## Creating a new ADR

```bash
npm run codegen
```

2. Select `ADR (Architectural Decision Record)` from the list of options
