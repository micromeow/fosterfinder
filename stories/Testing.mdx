<h1>Testing</h1>

Each component should at minimum have a snapshot test. This ensures that the
component is rendered correctly and that it doesn't change unexpectedly. To
run the tests, run the following command:

<Source code={`npm test`} />

<h2>Creating a test</h2>

You may use the following command to generate a test and storybook file for a component:

<Source code={`npm run codegen`} />

Or you may do it manually:

<Source code={`
import * as stories from "./Button.stories";
import { render } from "@testing-library/react";
import { composeStories } from "@storybook/react";

const asyncButtonStories = composeStories(stories);

const testCases = Object.values(asyncButtonStories).map((Story) => [
	// The ! is necessary in Typescript only, as the property is part of a partial type
	Story.storyName!,
	Story,
]);

test.each(testCases)("Renders %s story", async (\_storyName, Story) => {
	const tree = await render(<Story />);
	expect(tree.baseElement).toMatchSnapshot();
});
`}/>
