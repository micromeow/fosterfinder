<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>READ ME BEFORE DOING ANYTHING</h2>
<p>
  This is the introduction to the component library for Foster Finder. It is built on
  the <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/">shadcn/ui</a> component library, an open
  sourced component library built on{" "}
  <a href="https://tailwindcss.com">tailwindcss</a>.
</p>

<h2>Installing New Components from `shadcn`</h2>
<p>
  shadcn uses a "need-to-have" approach to adding new components. If you need to
  use a component that has not been installed in the `components/ui` directory,
  follow these steps to install it with the correct configuration.
</p>

1 - Install the component using the following command:

<Source code={`npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component-name>`} />

2 - <b>IMPORTANT</b>: Rename the generated component to use PascalCase. For example, if you are adding the component `button`, rename the component to `Button`.

3 - Generate stories and tests for the component using the following command:

<Source code={`npm run codegen`} />
